# Template repo for Kong GitOps
This is the customized version of decK-action for a local demo purpose.

This repo is the template repo, so please don't use this direclty. Please create your own repo from this template or even you can fork it if you prefer.

Why you shouldn't use this directly is becuase the self-hosted runner will be tied to each repo, so if you register the runner to this repo directly that will be running on your laptop, that runner will definitely conflict with the other runner that was already registered to this repo by the other SE.

Please create your own from this template instead. :bow:

## Prerequiste
- Make sure your kong demo environment running at localhost:8001
- Install decK v1.1.0 or later on your laptop
- Install git on your laptop
- Make sure you have nodejs v12 environment on your laptop

## How to use this
### 01. With this template, create your own repo that will store your kong config files
### 02. Do git clone the repo you created from the template
### 03. Build this action locally
Execute commands below:
```bash
$ npm i -g @zeit/ncc # if you already installed it, you can skip
$ ./scripts/compile.sh
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Build action locally"
```
### 04. Rename workflow files
Under `.github/workflows/` you can find three yaml files with `.template` suffix. You can reuse them with deleting the suffix from each.
```bash
$ mv .github/workflows/PR.yaml.template .github/workflows/PR.yaml
$ mv .github/workflows/PUSH.yaml.template .github/workflows/PUSH.yaml
$ mv .github/workflows/Reverse-Sync.yaml.template .github/workflows/Reverse-Sync.yaml
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Renamed workflow files"
```

```bash
$ cd kong

### 08. What if you configured Kong through UI?
No problem. After you did it at localhost:8002, then execute the command below:
